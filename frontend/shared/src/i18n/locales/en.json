    "howItWorksContent": "Couture guides you through the full garment creation process, from initial concept to finished pattern. The workflow follows the same steps used by professional fashion houses, but with computer assistance at every stage.",
    "howItWorksStep1": "Design your garment in the Designer Studio \u2014 sketch by hand or describe it to the AI.",
    "howItWorksStep2": "Find a matching base pattern in the Pattern Rack, or start from a sloper.",
    "howItWorksStep3": "Enter your measurements so the pattern fits your body.",
    "howItWorksStep4": "Fine-tune the pattern in the Modelist Corner \u2014 adjust ease, darts, and curves.",
    "howItWorksStep5": "Follow the Sewing instructions to cut and assemble your garment.",
    "gettingStartedIntro": "New to Couture? Here\u2019s the fastest way to your first pattern:",
    "gettingStartedStep1": "Go to Measurements and select your country and standard size. This pre-fills all 24 body measurements with standard values.",
    "gettingStartedStep2": "Adjust any measurements you know \u2014 the more accurate your inputs, the better the fit.",
    "gettingStartedStep3": "Open the Pattern Rack and choose a pattern.",
    "gettingStartedStep4": "The pattern is automatically sized to your measurements. Export it as a PDF and you\u2019re ready to cut.",
    "glossaryIntro": "Key terms used throughout Couture:",
    "sloper": "Sloper",
    "sloperDef": "A basic, close-fitting pattern shape from which other patterns are derived. Also called a block or base pattern. The sloper has no design features \u2014 it is the mathematical starting point.",
    "dart": "Dart",
    "dartDef": "A triangular fold sewn into fabric to shape it to the body\u2019s curves. Darts remove excess fabric and create three-dimensional form from a flat piece of cloth.",
    "ease": "Ease",
    "easeDef": "Extra room added to a pattern beyond exact body measurements. Wearing ease allows basic movement and comfort. Design ease adds additional room for a looser silhouette.",
    "grainLine": "Grain line",
    "grainLineDef": "The direction of the fabric\u2019s threads, which determines how it drapes and stretches. The lengthwise grain (warp) runs parallel to the selvage. Pattern pieces are aligned to the grain line to ensure proper drape.",
    "moulage": "Moulage",
    "moulageDef": "The technique of draping fabric directly on a dress form to create a pattern. Rather than drafting flat, the pattern is sculpted in three dimensions and then transferred to paper. Common in haute couture ateliers.",
    "faqFormats": "What file formats can I export?",
    "faqFormatsAnswer": "Couture supports PDF export for printing at home or at a copy shop, and SVG export for projector cutting.",
    "faqSizes": "Which sizes are supported?",
    "faqSizesAnswer": "The sizing table covers French sizes T34 through T48. You can also enter fully custom measurements for any body.",
    "faqSewing": "Do I need to know how to sew?",
    "faqSewingAnswer": "Couture focuses on pattern creation, not sewing instruction. Basic sewing skills are helpful, but the step-by-step assembly guide (coming soon) will walk you through construction."
