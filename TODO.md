Review the stretching,
    - Correct the curved curves with Beziers, add control points. Control points should be shown as "helper points", some of the previous helper points may be removed.
    - Add armhole_depth, and armhole_measurements on the pdf
    - may want to add some margin in the corset construction in some places
    - need to modify the rendering (in particular the rendering should be invariant to the stretching).

Finish the construction of the base corset.
Let's make a html website, where one can enter the measurements and get a printable construction pdf.
Then do the same with a real size pdf (or cut with various A4 and marks for the assembly).
Then integrate adverstising to the webpage.
