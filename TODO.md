Review the stretching,
    - may modify C2, do C2 at full bust, together with B1C2 = underarm_height
    - may want to add some margin in the corset construction in some places
    - need to modify the rendering (in particular the rendering should be invariant to the stretching).

Finish the construction of the base corset.
Let's make a html website, where one can enter the measurements and get a printable construction pdf.
Then do the same with a real size pdf (or cut with various A4 and marks for the assembly).
Then integrate adverstising to the webpage.
